# To-Do List App

## Description

A simple, yet powerful **To-Do List App** designed for task management. It offers various features such as:

* **Add Tasks** with details like due date, priority, categories, and reminders.
* **Task Recurrence** (daily, weekly, monthly).
* **Task Completion** toggle to mark tasks as complete or pending.
* **Dark Mode** toggle for user interface customization.
* **Analytics** including completion rate and task counts.
* **Sorting and Filtering** capabilities (by due date, priority, status, category).
* **File Attachments** for tasks (supporting images, PDFs, and documents).

The app stores data locally in `localStorage`, ensuring tasks persist between sessions.
